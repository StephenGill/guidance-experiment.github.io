# Government Functional Standard for digital

## Contribute to the cross-government service area roadmap

### What's covered in this guide

- At the moment, we make spend control decisions on a reactive basis, usually without any overarching view on what govt collectively wants the service area to evolve into.
- This guidance would provide new framework requiring individual spend control decisions about services to reference a wider plan for that service area. And allow / encourage positive spending on x-gov initiatives that advance the agreed roadmap.
