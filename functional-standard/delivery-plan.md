# Government Functional Standard for digital

## Planning for service digitisation and delivery

### What's covered in this section

- Create and maintain a list of services (as users understand them)
- Segment list of services into one of 3 types of intervention (based on political priority, need/capacity for legislation, any burning platform issues, known problems, budget, usage, criticality etc):
-- type 1: end to end service (re)design
-- type 2: incremental improvement (start by understanding current operational response and using tech to help optimise it)
-- type 3: digitisation (create a digital frontend without changing operational processes)"
- Identify a delivery and operating model for each service (bespoke built frontend vs GOV.UK Forms or COTS form platforms, identified service owner, funding to allow for proportionate level of contininuous improvement etc)
- How to reconcile digital delivery approaches with HMT green book processes
- When and how to use managed services and blended teams
- Bringing digital and operational delivery together / breaking down front / back office silos
- Proportionate approaches to operating and continuously improving services
